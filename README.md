Things that I didn't get to before running out of time:
1. Not all tests were finished
2. I didn't manage to fit in better error handling in the API functions
3. No view for `no results`
4. I intended to make the page more responsive, and render different sized rows based on viewport
5. I started adding logic to size the image container so it could hold a placeholder image before the real one was loaded, and better handle missing images
6. PAGINATION ðŸ˜–
